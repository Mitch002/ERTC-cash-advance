      <p>The Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) is a refundable tax credit that rewards employers for retaining their employees during the COVID-19 crisis. The ERTC can be worth up to $28,000 per employee for 2021, and up to $7,000 per employee per quarter for 2022. However, the IRS can take several months to process and issue the ERTC refund, which can create cash flow problems for many businesses.</p>
      <p>That's where ERC Bridge Loan comes in. ERC Bridge Loan is a cash advance program that allows you to get up to 75% of your expected ERTC refund within 24 hours of approval. You don't have to wait for the IRS to get your money. You can use the funds to pay your bills, invest in your business, or take advantage of new opportunities. ERC Bridge Loan is a simple and convenient way to access the ERTC and boost your business.</p>
